# srl-prometheus-exporter

This repo hosts a SR Linux NDK agent that exposes a Prometheus endpoint ready to be scraped by a Prometheus Server.

It uses SRL's gnmi-server over the unix socket address to retrieve gNMI updates, it then builds the Prometheus metrics and exposes them through a configurable HTTP address.

### Prerequisites:

- gNMI server unix socket is enabled
- The configured HTTP address and port are accepted by SRL CPM filters

### Installation

Download the RPM from the github releases page, copy it to your SRL instance and run:
```bash
sudo rpm -i srl-prometheus-exporter_0.1.0_Linux_x86_64.rpm
```

Connect to your SRL instance and reload the application manager
```bash
--{ + running }--[  ]--                                                                                                                                              
A:srl1# tools system app-management application app_mgr reload
```

Check that the `prometheus-exporter` app is now running
```bash
A:srl1# show system application | grep prometheus-exporter

--{ + running }--[  ]--     
```

### Configuration:

The metrics exposed can be configured using SRL's CLI

```text
--{ + running }--[ system prometheus-exporter ]--
A:srl1# info detail
    address ::
    port 8888
    network-instance mgmt
    http-path /metrics
    admin-state enable
    metric interfaces {
        state enable
        help-text "SRLinux generated metric"
    }
```

The predefined metric names and the corresponding gNMI paths used to build the metrics are as below: 

|               metric name              	|                            gNMI paths                          	|

The predefined paths and metrics names can be changed at startup using a configuration file.

Custom metrics can be added at runtime using SRL's CLI/gNMI/JSON-RPC interfaces as below:

```text
--{ + candidate shared default }--[ system prometheus-exporter ]--
A:srl1# custom-metric my_metric paths [ /network-instance/protocols/bgp/statistics ]
--{ +* candidate shared default }--[ system prometheus-exporter ]-- 
A:srl1# commit now
All changes have been committed. Leaving candidate mode.

    // snipped...
    custom-metric my_metric {
        paths [

        ]
    }
```
